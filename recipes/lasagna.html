	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 pound ground beef or turkey</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>2 (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
		<li>1 (15-ounce) can ricotta cheese</li>
		<li>2 large eggs</li>
		<li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
		<li>16oz Lasagna noodles</li>
		<li>8 oz shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
		<!-- Add more ingredients as needed -->
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Cook the meat sauce:</strong> Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking up any lumps with a spoon. Drain excess fat and stir in crushed tomatoes, sugar, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
		<li><strong>Prepare the ricotta mixture:</strong> In a mixing bowl, beat ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese until well combined. Stir in parsley.</li>
		<li><strong>Prep the noodles:</strong> Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
		<li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Spread about half of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 3-quart baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, another layer of meat sauce, and a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat this process until all ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
		<li><strong>Cover and bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 20 minutes or until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown.</li>
